# Useful_SQLServer_Scripts

This is a space to share useful scripts that I normally use on a daily basis.

Simple but it helps me from needing to rewrite them everytime I need, and it's always in hand.

Feel free to use and share it.

If you find something that can be improved, feel free to submit a PR, and I'll check it ASAP.
